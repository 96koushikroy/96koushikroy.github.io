  Hi all, I'm Koushik, a computer scientist from Bangladesh. I have been working in academic research for the past two years. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the NSU-Apurba R&D Lab at North South University, working on Bangla OCR for a project by the Government of Bangladesh. Previously, I have worked at [Gaze Pte. Ltd.](https://gaze.ai/){:target="_blank"} as a Deep Learning Researcher working on Face Liveliness Detection for Biometric Authentication pipelines.

  Apart from this, I have been a part of multiple industry-academia collaborations with companies like [Headblocks Ltd.](http://www.head-blocks.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Apurba Technologies Inc.](http://www.apurbatech.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked on ML-based solutions that would ameliorate their pre-existing conditions. 

  Other than academics, I am an avid enthusiast for algorithmic problem solving, being a sport programmer during my undergraduate study, represented my university at multiple national and international competitions.

            Working at the Apurba-NSU R&D Lab, conducting research on Bangla OCR on a government-funded project primarily focused towards low-resource approaches, and developing NLP downstream tasks (NER, PoS Tagging, QA, etc.) using popular language models.

            Worked on Vehicle Re-identification for the CVPR AICITY Challenge 2020, Knowledge Distillation for model optimization, and Face Recognition. Current research includes a Novel Face Spoof Detection (Gazeâ€™s Flagship product) architecture which would leverage DL techniques and deploying PyTorch models with a C++ backend. My publications from this lab are available on the Publications section.
